# What is this?

This is a starter project for a single page application using Node, Express, Mongo DB, and OAuth ( Google, Facebook, etc ...)

# Running the Projects

1. First, to install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node</a> ( and NPM - which is included ).

2. Next, install <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community">Mongo DB Server</a>. You should also set up Mongo DB in your Environment variables / PATH if you are running on Windows.

3. Next, create an <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient">OAuth Client ID in the Google Console</a>. The client id and secret key generated by this will need to be updated in config/auth.js

4. Next, install the project's node dependencies by running "npm install".

5. Next, run the Mongo Database Server by running "mongod --dbpath=db"
